# Interest Calculator

**Interest Calculator** is a command-line interface based calculator that helps you calculate interest easier and simpler. It was created entirely by me in Python as a simple project to not only boost my skills in Python, but also to help anyone who wants to calculate interest much faster.

### How to Install
1. Go to the Releases tab and click whatever is shown. It should be the most recent build (ex: v1.0).
2. Download the FIRST .zip file. It should be named something like "interest-calculator" followed by the version (ex: interest-calculator-v1.3).
3. Extract the zip folder, and run "interest-calculator.exe"
4. Enjoy!

**ALTERNATIVELY:** You could install the source code, and run it by running "winrun.bat" or through windows command prompt (if you know how to use it).
